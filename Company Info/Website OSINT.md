Info from website:

Googling “Croissant Cruises” (quote from website) shows a domain called [https://croissantcruises.live/](https://croissantcruises.live/) that was registered on 2025-08-14 and updated on 2025-08-19 (allports.tours was registered on 2025-08-14 and edited on 2025-08-19 and [allportstours.com](http://allportstours.com) was registered and updated on 2025-08-16) Also, the ghandi registration for both of these ends in "-DONUTS" which seems to be a custom identifier.
