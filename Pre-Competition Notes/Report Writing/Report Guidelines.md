**Notes from the [CPTC website](https://cp.tc/compete/reporting) on how to write a report:**

1. **Do** include technical evidence that you were able to perform an issue. While this may be different in a professional setting, where you can have multiple deliverables, at CPTC you have one, and we need to be able to reperform what you’ve done or see that you’ve done it clearly.
2. **Don’t** include unredacted sensitive customer, employee, or intellectual property information in reports. Strive to aim higher than your client, who may have been terrible at storing information securely:
3. **Do** include references to findings or relevant information to help your audience locate information and solve issues, such as technical links, example commands or code to fix the issue, etc.
4. **Don’t** use hyperlinks where without the full link, as reports are often printed or converted to PDF.
5. **Do** use professional, third person, language and provide an explanation for everything you include, a screenshot on it’s own doesn’t communicate as much as one with context.
6. **Don’t** personally blame the client for any issues identified. Avoid second-person wording, such as phrases beginning with the word “you”.
7. **Do** include an executive summary, and make sure it’s appropriate for the intended audience and level.
8. **Don’t** include excessive technical detail in an executive summary. This audience may not know what an IP address is, let alone care about it. This will often confuse the reader and cause more questions and concern than necessary.
9. **Do** recognize that your client will have questions about your findings, and you will be asked to reperform some activities within client environments to validate their remediation. Clients that partner with you throughout the testing process are the clients you will want to work with year after year and are the ones that will often want to work with you.
10. **Don’t** just show the client how they messed up, show what they did well to give them some credit. A positive start can make a massive overall difference in how your message is received.
11. **Do** always seek to learn and improve. The information security field is a relatively small, tight-knit community - and your reputation for quality work and integrity are incredibly valuable.
12. **Don’t** forget to proofread and spell check your report. These errors undermine your credibility and make your overall message less professional.
13. **Do** provide reports in formats where they cannot be easily modified. Customers may want certain findings omitted from reports, but you should only document the resolution of these findings once they’re remediated if you have validated the remediation and are still within the timeframe of your engagement. In general, findings should never be removed from a report as without the engagement they would have not been identified and resolved.
14. **Don’t** share your report with a client in an insecure way. Malicious actors would love to get their hands on one, documentation on all the weaknesses will save them effort.
