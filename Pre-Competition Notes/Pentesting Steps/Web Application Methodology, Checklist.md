    **Enumerating Web Server’s Applications**
    
    ### Enumerating with Nmap
    
    ### **Basic Full TCP Port Scan**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p- target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Scan all 65,535 TCP ports (not just top 1,000).
    - **Example:** Finds an open `8080` Tomcat panel not on standard ports.
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. **Service Version Detection**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sV target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Identify software and versions running on open ports.
    - **Example:** Reveals `Apache httpd 2.4.49` → vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773.
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. **Aggressive Scan (Info Gathering)**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -A target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Detect OS, services, traceroute, scripts (all-in-one).
    - **Example:** Identifies Ubuntu 20.04 + Nginx + SSH fingerprint.
    
    ---
    
    ### 4. **Scan with Default NSE Scripts**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sC -sV target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Run Nmap’s default scripts alongside service detection.
    - **Example:** Discovers SSL/TLS cert info, HTTP titles, SMB shares.
    
    ---
    
    ### 5. **Vulnerability Scan (NSE Vuln Scripts)**
    
    ```bash
    nmap --script vuln target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Check for common known vulnerabilities.
    - **Example:** Detects outdated SMB service vulnerable to EternalBlue.
    
    ---
    
    ### 6. **UDP Scan (Common Ports)**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sU --top-ports 20 target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Check top UDP ports (53, 123, 161, etc.).
    - **Example:** Finds SNMP service on UDP/161 leaking system info.
    
    ---
    
    ### 7. **Specific Port Range + Service Detection**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p 21,22,80,443,8000-9000 -sV target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Target specific ports and ranges for faster scanning.
    - **Example:** Finds admin panel running on `8443`.
    
    ---
    
    ### 8. **Scripted SMB Enumeration**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -p 139,445 --script smb-enum-shares,smb-enum-users target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Enumerate SMB shares and users.
    - **Example:** Lists open share `/public` with sensitive files.
    
    ---
    
    ### 9. **Stealth Scan (SYN Scan)**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sS target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Quick and stealthy TCP scan (doesn’t complete handshake).
    - **Example:** Detects open ports without full connection logs (if IDS isn’t configured well).
    
    ---
    
    ### 10. **Output to All Formats (for reporting/grep)**
    
    ```bash
    nmap -sC -sV -oA scan_results target.com
    
    ```
    
    - **Use Case:** Save results in normal, greppable, and XML formats for later analysis.
    - **Example:** Useful in CTF writeups or pentest reporting.

    ---
    
    ### **Burp Spider (Content Discovery)**
    
    - **Method:** Right-click target → **Engagement tools → Spider this host**.
    - **Example:** Spider discovers `/api/v2/admin/` endpoints not linked in the UI.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _Content Discovery_ plugin (bApp store) → wordlist-based brute-forcing for APIs.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Burp Repeater (Manual Fuzzing)**
    
    - **Method:** Send requests to **Repeater**, try modifying params, HTTP verbs, or endpoints.
    - **Example:** Change `GET /api/v1/users/1` → `/api/v1/users/2` → finds IDOR.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _Param Miner_ → suggests hidden/guessable parameters.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Burp Intruder (Parameter & Endpoint Bruteforce)**
    
    - **Method:** Use wordlists (`/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/api.txt`) in Intruder.
    - **Example:** Fuzz `/api/v1/FUZZ` → finds `/api/v1/debug`.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _Turbo Intruder_ → faster async fuzzing.
    
    ---
    
    ### **JS File Analysis (Static Discovery)**
    
    - **Method:** Inspect JavaScript responses in Burp Proxy (or use search). Look for `fetch()`, `axios`, `xhr.open()`.
    - **Example:** `main.js` leaks `/api/internal/logs`.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _JS Link Finder_ → automatically extracts endpoints from JS files.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Burp Logger++ (Advanced Logging)**
    
    - **Plugin:** _Logger++_ logs every request/response in detail.
    - **Method:** Filter for `/api/` calls or JSON responses.
    - **Example:** Identifies undocumented `/api/v3/export` endpoint only used by admin role.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Burp Active Scan + API-Specific Checks**
    
    - **Method:** Send discovered endpoints to **Scanner**.
    - **Example:** Finds `OPTIONS` method enabled on `/api/v1/upload`.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _API Scanner_ → dedicated scans for REST/GraphQL.
    
    ---
    
    ### **GraphQL & Swagger Enumeration**
    
    - **Method:**
        - Look for `/graphql`, `/graphiql`, `/swagger.json`, `/openapi.json`.
        - Import into Burp → auto-generate requests.
    - **Example:** Swagger file leaks `/api/admin/resetPassword`.
    - **Plugin Boosts:**
        - _GraphQL Raider_ → introspection + query building.
        - _Swagger Parser_ → imports OpenAPI specs into Burp.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Burp Search (Custom Grep)**
    
    - **Method:** Use **Search (Ctrl+Shift+S)** → look for `api`, `v1`, `token`, `jwt`.
    - **Example:** Finds hardcoded `Authorization: Bearer` tokens in JS files.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _Sensitive Data Detector_ → highlights secrets in responses.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Burp Collaborator (Out-of-Band Discovery)**
    
    - **Method:** Modify endpoints with payloads → watch Burp Collaborator for callbacks.
    - **Example:** `/api/v1/webhook` → leaks server-side request execution to Collaborator.
    - **Plugin Boost:** _Collaborator Everywhere_ → injects Collaborator payloads automatically in headers/params.
    
    ---
    
    # Pro Pentest Workflow with Burp for APIs
    
    1. Proxy traffic → capture normal requests.
    2. Site map + Spider → auto-discover hidden endpoints.
    3. Use **JS Link Finder** on JavaScript → enumerate `/api/*`.
    4. Intruder + Param Miner → fuzz missing params/endpoints.
    5. Swagger/GraphQL Raider → expand API surface.
    6. Scan with _Logger++_ running for visibility.
